# BeHealthy app
BeHealthy is a hybrid mobile application  that helps users to take care of their health and be healthy.
## Features:
  - Track your health routine: whether it symptoms, illness, pressure or pulse, you can track it all with our intuitive interface

### Tech
BeHealthy uses a number of projects to work properly:

* [Ionic Framework] - a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile application development that is build on Angular
* [Apache Cordova] - a mobile application development framework (Android / iOS) 
* [node.js] with npm - evented I/O for the backend
* [JSLint] - a code quality tool that checks for problems in Javascript programs 
* [Firebase] - a mobile and web application development platform
* [Webpack] - an open-source JavaScript module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules
* [Git] - a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people 
* [JDK] - the Java Development Kit is the official development kit for the Java programming language
* [Android SDK] - the  Android SDK provides you the API libraries and developer tools necessary to build, test, and debug apps for Android

And of course BeHealthy itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/arkfil/Gramy) on GitHub
